<h1><span class="header-section-number">5</span> Course delivery type</h1>
<p>To accommodate physical distancing and other safety measures necessitated by the coronavirus pandemic, the university is making changes to its Spring 2021 course schedule. <strong>This course will be taught remotely.</strong> This means that courses meet virtually via technology (here Zoom) at scheduled class meeting times. Students are also expected to be working individually and reporting on their progress during either scheduled class meeting times or individual meetings with their mentors.</p>
<div id="what-technology-do-you-need" class="section level2" number="5.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> What technology do you need?</h2>
<p>Here are some key points for remote teaching:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will need reliable access to a computer with an internet connection and a webcam.</li>
<li>You will need to install a suite of software on your computer (<a href="https://boisestate.zoom.us">Zoom</a>, <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">R</a>, <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">RStudio</a>). Please see <a href="#software">the computing tools of reproducible science</a> section below for more details.</li>
<li>More information on Zoom provided by BSU is available <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/oit-learning/video/zoom/">here</a>.</li>
<li>VPN access using <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client-v4-x/model.html#~tab-downloads">Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client</a>. This software will facilitate remote access to Linux boxes for bioinformatic analyses. Students using Windows operating systems will have to download Putty or a similar software to remotely access Linux computer using <code>ssh</code> protocol. Putty can be downloaded at this URL <a href="http://www.putty.org" class="uri">http://www.putty.org</a> (follow instructions to install it on your computer).</li>
<li>If you have concerns about access to technology needed for your courses this fall, the <a href="https://www.boisestate.edu/oit/assistance/">Help Desk</a> is the place to begin to discuss your needs. The instructor would also gladly help you with any technology needs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Friday from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This time slot will be used for teaching, research lab meetings and presenting scientific results. At the end of our meetings (most likely in the last 10 minutes), we will be taking advantage of the Zoom breakout room feature to allow students to discuss with their mentors and report on their progress as well as set individual weekly expectations.</p>
<p>Finally, we are requiring students to allocate time outside of class to advance their individual research projects (see below for more details). We will be discussing setting-up weekly meetings to discuss with their mentors and reporting progress.</p>
</div>
<div id="zoom-information" class="section level2" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Zoom information</h2>
<p>Class will take place remotely using the <a href="https://boisestate.zoom.us">Zoom</a> platform. A fully-licensed Zoom account is available to all faculty, staff, and students at Boise State. Zoom is a great tool for conducting remote meetings that allows you to see and hear one another, chat, share your computer screen, and more. In our case, we will be taking advantage of the remote control and breakout room features. The first feature will allow users to take control of another participant’s screen in a meeting. This is especially useful to help working on and debugging R code. The second feature will maximizing communication between students and their mentors.

<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Course goal &amp; description</h1>
<p>Students are joining a multi-disciplinary team to study the effect of climate change on northwestern US ecosystems. More specifically, students will be contributing to studying the effect of climate change on plants by investigating the contribution of genomic processes in underpinning phenotypes that are adapted to our rapidly changing environment. This will be done by designing, implementing and performing genotype-environment experiments, conducting gene expression analyses and identifying candidate genes underpinning environmental adaptations. Each of those steps in the scientific process will be supported by bioinformatic analyses. To broaden skills, students will receive targeted skills through three modules representing their scientific progression:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1:</strong> Bioinformatics (here those tools are geared towards using R and UNIX-based systems to mine, download and analyze genomic data and linking those to phenotypes and environmental conditions).</li>
<li><strong>Module 2:</strong> Greenhouse (design and conduct controlled GxE experiments to assess the ability of plants to cope with megadrought). Conducting greenhouse experiments might also involve conducting fieldwork in northwestern US (to collect seeds and tissue for laboratory analyses).</li>
<li><strong>Module 3:</strong> Laboratory (e.g. DNA/RNA extractions, qPCR, <em>in vitro</em> tissue culture).</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the pandemic, the Spring 2021 semester will be devoted on learning and implementing methodologies mostly associated to module 1.</p>
<p>This VIP course is integrated into the NSF Idaho EPSCoR <a href="https://www.idahogem3.org">GEM3</a> program, which will provide opportunities for students to engage with members of this state wide initiative as well as multiple stakeholders (both national and regional).</p>

<p>For this semester, the course is subdivided into four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>PART 1: Introduction to reproducible science, bioinformatics and genomic tools</em></li>
<li><em>PART 2: Produce a research proposal</em></li>
<li><em>PART 3: Conduct research project</em></li>
<li><em>PART 4: Present your research</em></li>

Figure 8.1: Summary of the bioinformatic workflow that will be taught in this course.
</p>
</div>
<p>Part 1 aims at providing students with key theoretical knowledge on this topic allowing them to successfully design a reproducible approach tailored to genome 2 phenome research. We will also concentrate on learning the RMarkdown computing language to mesh the different steps of the scientific process into a unique framework (see Figure <a href="#fig:part2">8.1</a>). Part 2 will be devoted to work with your mentors in developing an individual research proposal, which will be used as a benchmark to conduct your project (phase 3). Ultimately, this process will lead to the completion of a reproducible report, which will be used to carve an oral presentation at the end of the semester (part 4). We are advising students to start discussing their research questions with the team early in the semester to maximize your research experience.</p>
</div>
<div id="course-learning-outcomes" class="section level1" number="9">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Course learning outcomes</h1>

<ul>
<li>Be a kind, respectful and active team member.</li>
<li>Solve problems.</li>
<li>Read scientific publications on genome 2 phenome research.</li>
<li>Conduct a literature review using our <em>G2Pminer</em> R package.</li>
<li>Use your literature review to design a research proposal.</li>
<li>Lead and conduct a research project.</li>
<li>Write a reproducible report.</li>
<li>Practice communicating scientific results to peers.</li>
<li>Learn computer programming in R and/or UNIX-based systems (Linux) geared towards analyzing genomic data.</li>

</div>
<div id="publications-textbooks" class="section level1" number="11">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">11</span> <a name="Publis"></a>Publications &amp; textbooks</h1>
<p>There are no assigned textbook to this course, however students will be reading scientific papers associated to their individual research projects. The team will be assisting students in reading and understanding scientific papers.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-computing-tools-of-reproducible-science" class="section level1" number="12">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">12</span> <a name="software"></a>The computing tools of reproducible science</h1>
<p>Research is often presented in the form of slideshows, articles or books. These presentation documents announce a project’s findings, but they are not the research, they are the advertisement part of the research project!</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The research is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the results <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Donoho2010" role="doc-biblioref">Donoho, 2010</a>)</span>.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When we separate the research from its advertisement, we are making it difficult for others to verify the findings by reproducing them.</strong></p>
<p>This course will give you the tools to dynamically combine your research with the presentation of your findings. The first tool will be a workflow for reproducible research weaving the principles of reproducibility throughout your entire research project, from data gathering to the statistical analysis, and the presentation of results. To reach this goal, you will learn how to use a number of computer tools that make this workflow possible. We will also be using a suite of bioinformatic tools associated to analyzing genomic data (e.g. BLAST, DNA alignment, secondary and tertiary protein structure, promoter analyses). We will do our very best to use bioinformatic pipelines, which are available online.</p>
<div id="the-bioinformatic-tools" class="section level2" number="12.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.1</span> The bioinformatic tools</h2>
<p>The main bioinformatic tools covered in this course are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>R</strong> statistical language that will allow you to gather data and analyze it.</li>
<li>The <strong>LaTeX</strong> and <strong>Markdown</strong> markup languages that you can use to create documents (slideshows, articles, books, webpages) for presenting your findings.</li>
<li>The <em>knitr</em> and <em>rmarkdown</em> <strong>packages</strong> for R and other tools, including <strong>command-line shell programs</strong> like GNU Make and Git version control, for dynamically tiding your data gathering, analysis, and presentation documents together so that they can be easily reproduced.</li>
<li><strong>RStudio</strong>, a program that brings all of these tools together in one place.</li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.3</span> Installing markup languages</h2>
<p>If you are planning to create LaTeX documents, you will need to install a Tex distribution. Please refer to this website for more details: <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/get/" class="uri">https://www.latex-project.org/get/</a></p>
<p>If you want to create Markdown documents you can separately install the <em>rmarkdown</em> package in R (see <a href="#Rpack">below</a> for more details).</p>

<div id="installing-r-packages" class="section level2" number="12.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">12.4</span> <a name="Rpack"></a>Installing R packages</h2>
<p>We will be using a number of R packages especially designed to support reproducible research. Many of those packages are not included in the default R installation and will need to be installed separately.
To install key packages used in class, copy the following code and paste it into your R console:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(c(&quot;brew&quot;, &quot;countrycode&quot;, &quot;devtools&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;googleVis&quot;, 
    &quot;knitr&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;, &quot;xtable&quot;))</code></pre>
<p>Once you enter this code, you may be asked to select a CRAN “mirror” to download the packages from. Simply select the mirror closest to you.</p>
<p>Finally, it is highly likely that we will have to install additional packages. In this case, you can simply install it by using the same R function <code>install.packages()</code> or by using RStudio as follows: Select “Tools” -&gt; “Install Packages …” and then type the name of the package in the window (make sure to tick the “Install dependencies” box).</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">15</span> Assessment &amp; grading</h1>
<p>There will not be any classical exams in this VIP course, but we will rather focus on developing theoretical and bioinformatic skills and applying those to research. In this context, each student will be asked to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attend weekly research lab meetings (TOTAL 32 points; 2 points per lab).</li>
<li>Produce a research proposal, execute research and write reproducible report (TOTAL 300 points).</li>
<li>Present their research to their peers (TOTAL 50 points). Last semester students have presented posters at the BSU VIP symposium. We expect this event to be organized at the end of this semester and will therefore requested attendance from our students.</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated above, we expect students to write their research proposals and reports using the RMarkdown language, which allows integrating data, code and text. We are aware that students are at different stages of their curriculum and have also signed up for 1 or 2 credits. In this context, we will be establishing expectations and associated milestones on an individual basis, but each student will have three graded assessments to deliver (see above to know more about point allocations). Attending research lab meetings is expected semester long (32 points), whereas we will set specific deadlines to produce the research proposal (100 points), execute the research (100 points) and write the reproducible report (100 points). Finally, oral presentations (50 points) will take place during the last two weeks of the semester and consist of 15 minutes powerpoint presentations. The reproducible report should be submitted to the instructor on week 16 for grading. However, we will be grading your research proposal and research execution prior to submission of the final report. Finally, we would like to stress that you are not alone in this endeavor, but rather part of a team. This means that you will be working alongside mentors, which will be able to provide guidance and comment on your research.</p>
<p>Students will be graded based on the three tasks presented above and those are summing to a total of <strong>382 points</strong>. Table <a href="#tab:mygrade">15.1</a> exhibits the grading scale applied in this course.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">17</span> Engagement expectations</h1>
<p>The remote teaching mode of this course makes it harder for the instructor to take attendance. The instructor is expecting students to attend research lab meetings (please join on time and for the full duration of the meeting) and actively engage by asking questions and giving feedback on teaching material and course content. This course was designed to help students implementing a reproducible approach to their research projects. If you are judging that additional content should be covered, please contact the instructor. The instructor will do his very best to obtain information or seek support from the team to cover the requested material. Finally, the instructor is aware that COVID could potentially impact yourselves and your families. In the case that you have any issues attending class or conducting your research, please contact the instructor by email (<a href="mailto:svenbuerki@boisestate.edu" class="email">svenbuerki@boisestate.edu</a>) asap and see below for more details.</p>

<p>The instructor and the team will be prepared for class, on time and not leave early. We will also be respectful of you and your opinions. Overall, we want to foster a kind and respectful class environment where all students can express themselves and share their opinions. This means that meaningful and constructive dialogue is encouraged in this class and it requires a degree of mutual respect, willingness to listen, and tolerance of opposing points of view. Respect for individual differences and alternative viewpoints will be maintained at all times in this class. One’s words and use of language should be temperate and within acceptable bounds of civility and decency. Finally, we will reply to emails and grade tests as soon as possible (and provide positive criticism) to allow students mastering the material presented in class.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that this is not a classical course since students will be immersed into research. This means that we will do our very best to guide students into research, but we don’t have answers to all your questions.</p>
